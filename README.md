# War_Analysis
Taking the novice card game of war and analyzing it in games of 2 vs 3+. Analysis in terms of turns until winner, or if there ever is a winner at certain levels! 

BASICALLY:
  In war the deck of cards is split into equal parts. The player(s) then put the first card in the deck face up, and whoever has the highest card value wins the pot of cards played, and this is repeated until a player runs out of cards. Normally 10-15 minute game but I am wanting to prove it!
